🌟 Context

We’re building a dynamic, temporally-aware multi-tenant knowledge graph powered by Graphiti. Our aim is to create a robust meta-layer that AI agents will rely upon as their memory, grounding context, and decision-making hub.

Unlike static retrieval systems, Graphiti integrates data continuously from user interactions, structured/unstructured sources, and external systems. The architecture supports incremental updates, efficient retrieval, and rich temporal context, essential for dynamic AI agent interactions.

🚀 Plan (Strategy)

Implement a semantic-first organization approach. Clearly categorize all entities based on what they represent:
	•	Actions: Execution-oriented knowledge (procedures, workflows)
	•	Constraints: Conditions, requirements, rules, factual edges
	•	Interaction: Human-agent interactions, collaboration flows, dialogue models, user preferences
	•	Connectors: Aggregation entities linking context across the graph (Agents, Projects, Resources, Goals, ContextBundles)
	•	Resources: External/internal reference documentation or tools that support agent decision-making

Start minimal and expand thoughtfully. Leverage Graphiti’s existing architecture and avoid redundancies.

🗂️ Structure

The following minimal directory structure represents your semantic organization clearly:

entities/
├── actions/
│   └── procedure.py
├── constraints/
│   └── requirement.py
├── interaction/
│   ├── interaction_model.py
│   └── preference.py
├── connectors/
│   ├── agent.py
│   ├── project.py
│   ├── resource.py
│   └── goal.py
└── resources/
    └── documentation.py

	•	Episodes → connectors/context_bundle.py (captures raw episodes and contextual history)
	•	Facts → represented implicitly as labeled relationships (no explicit node)
	•	Communities → future connectors (implicitly supported, explicit if necessary)

Each entity file clearly states extraction guidelines and structure (Pydantic models).

🌈 Vibe (Guiding Philosophy)

Embrace clarity, simplicity, and flexibility. Aim for semantic rigor and intuitive discoverability.
	•	Think Clearly: If unsure about an entity, defer until concrete necessity.
	•	Stay Aligned: Leverage Graphiti’s strengths; avoid reinventing what Graphiti already does well.
	•	Grow Intuitively: Expand or subclass only when it explicitly simplifies or enhances interactions.
	•	Prioritize Communication: Always document intent clearly, preserving context and meaning.
