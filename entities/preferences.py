    """A Preference represents a user's expressed like, dislike, or preference for something.

    Instructions for identifying and extracting preferences:
    1. Look for explicit statements of preference such as "I like/love/enjoy/prefer X" or "I don't like/hate/dislike X"
    2. Pay attention to comparative statements ("I prefer X over Y")
    3. Consider the emotional tone when users mention certain topics
    4. Extract only preferences that are clearly expressed, not assumptions
    5. Categorize the preference appropriately based on its domain (food, music, brands, etc.)
    6. Include relevant qualifiers (e.g., "likes spicy food" rather than just "likes food")
    7. Only extract preferences directly stated by the user, not preferences of others they mention
    8. Provide a concise but specific description that captures the nature of the preference
